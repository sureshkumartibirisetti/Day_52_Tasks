// 1. Scenario: Online Library Membership
// ---------------------------------------
// Context: An online library offers different levels of membership. Depending on the type of membership, users have access to different resources:

// Basic Membership: Access to only free books.

// Standard Membership: Access to free books and discounted paid books.

// Premium Membership: Access to all books, including exclusive content.

// Question: Imagine you have a variable that stores a userâ€™s membership type. Using conditional statements, determine what resources the user can access and display a message indicating their access level. Consider how you would handle a situation where the membership type is invalid.

var mem="basic";

if(mem=="basic"){
    console.log("Access to only free books.");
}else if(mem=="standard"){
    console.log("Access to all books, including exclusive content.");
}else if(mem=="premium"){
    console.log("Access to all books, including exclusive content.");
}else{
    console.log("Invalid membership");
}
