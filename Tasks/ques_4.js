// 4. Scenario: Movie Ticket Pricing
// ----------------------------------
// Context: A movie theater charges different prices based on the day of the week and the customer's age:

// Weekdays: Standard price of $12. Seniors (65 and older) and children (under 12) receive a 50% discount.

// Weekends: Standard price of $15. Seniors and children receive a 30% discount.

// Question: Assume you have variables for the day of the week and the customerâ€™s age. Use conditional statements to determine the correct ticket price. Consider how to handle situations where the day or age is invalid.

var week=prompt();
var age=prompt();
age=Number.parseInt(age);
if(week=="weekdays"){
    var sp=12;
    if(65<=age || age<12){
        console.log(`Seniors (65 and older) and children (under 12) receive a 50% discount.you pay $ ${sp*0.5}`);
    }else{
        console.log(`standard price $ ${sp}`);
    }
}else if(week=="weekends"){
    var sp=15;
    if(65<=age || age<12){
        console.log(`Seniors (65 and older) and children (under 12) receive a 50% discount.you pay $ ${sp*0.3}`);
    }else{
        console.log(`standard price $ ${sp}`);
    } 
}else{
    console.log("please enter valid data");
